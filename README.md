## Final project for 10th grade computer science class
Author: Eyal Raifler
#### Project Overview
This is a simple Blackjack game developed in Assembly language (8086 TASM 16-bit), designed to run in DosBox.
It was built as part of a final project at school, with the goal of practicing low-level programming and better understanding computer architecture.

Main file: base.asm

Development environment: VS Code, Notepad++

Assembler: Turbo Assembler (TASM)
